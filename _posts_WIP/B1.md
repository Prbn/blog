### Tell Me About Yourself:

Sure! My name is Prabin Shrestha, and I bring over 5 years of experience in data analysis and engineering, with a strong foundation in financial services and risk analytics. I began my career as a Data Analyst at Essex Lake Group, where I focused on credit risk modeling, portfolio analysis, and fraud metrics like EAD, LGD, and RAROC for banking clients in South Africa. This role gave me hands-on experience processing massive datasets—up to 8 TB—and developing dashboards and scorecards that helped reduce expected loss by 15%.

Later, I joined Axtria as a Senior Associate, where I led efforts to build and optimize large-scale data pipelines using PySpark and AWS EMR, enhancing data processing efficiency by 30%. I also supported pharmaceutical and healthcare clients, combining technical expertise with business insight to deliver high-impact analytics solutions. During this time, I also mentored team members and received recognition for innovation and performance.

Most recently, I completed my master’s in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University, where I worked as a Graduate Assistant and applied NLP and contextual analysis to improve student engagement strategies, winning a university award for my work.

I’m now looking to bring together my fraud analytics experience, technical skills in Python, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS, and a deep understanding of risk and compliance to a mission-driven organization like LexisNexis. I’m particularly excited about this role because of your focus on using data to support investigations and mitigate fraud at scale.

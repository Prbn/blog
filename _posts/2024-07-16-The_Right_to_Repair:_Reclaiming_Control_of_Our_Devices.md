# The Right to Repair: Reclaiming Control of Our Devices

In a world where technology dominates every aspect of our lives, the concept of ownership over our devices is increasingly under threat. From smartphones and laptops to cars and agricultural equipment, the notion of truly owning these products is becoming more complex. Over the years, we've seen a gradual erosion of our rights to repair and maintain the very devices we've purchased. This has led to frustration and a growing movement demanding change: the Right to Repair.

## Understanding the Right to Repair

Right to Repair is the principle that consumers should have the ability to fix the products they own without undue restriction from manufacturers. This means having access to parts, tools, repair manuals, and software updates necessary to maintain and repair these devices. However, many companies have implemented policies and designs that make independent repair difficult, expensive, or outright impossible.

Companies should not hide access to parts, documents, schematics, and other necessary resources to repair your personal property. Whether we’re talking about Samsung charging $126 for a phone battery you could get on eBay for $20, or other similar examples, the right to repair is about making these repairs accessible and affordable.

Right to repair is the concept that there should not be any hindrance to be able to fix what you own. 

## The Legislative Landscape

On October 2023, California passed the Right to Repair Act, which requires manufacturers to provide the necessary tools and parts for electronic device repairs. This legislation is a significant victory for consumers and repair advocates, but it's only the beginning. More than a dozen other states in the U.S. are considering similar bills, and the European Union has been pushing forward legislation to benefit end-users, including mandating USB-C ports for all handheld devices by 2024.

Despite over a decade of advocacy work, we have made little progress. In fact, customers and repair shops are worse off now than they were ten years ago. Essential parts and resources necessary for economically viable repairs have dried up. This situation affects both end-users trying to do DIY repairs and repair shops attempting to offer services.

Even with the passing of right to repair legislation, many companies will likely engage in what I call “malicious compliance.” This means they will comply in the most minimal and least helpful ways possible. For example, they might provide repair manuals that are insufficient for actual repairs or claim that their products are exempt from the law.

## Real-World Examples

### Apple: A Case Study

Apple is often cited as a major opponent of the Right to Repair. The company has implemented a range of practices that restrict repair options, such as parts pairing, which ensures that only original parts can be used in repairs. This makes even simple repairs like screen replacements challenging without going through official channels. 

For example, the iPhone 15, released in 2023, is one of the most software-locked phones to date. Parts from one iPhone 15 cannot be used in another of the same model, leading to disabled features or non-functional parts if attempted. Apple’s control extends to the repair ecosystem as well. Independent repair shops face numerous hurdles, including limited access to genuine parts and the risk of their repairs being rendered ineffective by software updates. 

Apple's Independent Repair Provider (IRP) program, which ostensibly supports third-party repair, has been criticized for its stringent requirements and limited scope. Participants must adhere to strict guidelines and face audits, and they can only perform a narrow range of repairs. This program has been seen more as a way to appease regulators than a genuine effort to support independent repair.

### John Deere: The Agricultural Dilemma

Farmers have faced significant challenges with John Deere's tractors, where software locks prevent them from repairing their equipment. John Deere's tractors are equipped with sophisticated software that monitors and controls various functions. When something breaks, the software often locks the system, requiring an authorized dealer to reset it. This has led to increased downtime and costs for farmers.

Farmers have turned to hacked solutions to keep their machinery running. These hacks, often obtained from online forums or even the dark web, allow them to bypass the software locks and perform necessary repairs. John Deere argues that these measures are necessary to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety. However, the practical effect is increased costs and inconvenience for the end-user. 

In 2021, John Deere faced legal challenges and public outcry over these practices. A group of farmers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company’s practices violated antitrust laws. While the case is ongoing, it has brought significant attention to the issue and galvanized support for the Right to Repair movement in the agricultural sector.

### Tesla: Electric Cars and Repair Challenges

Tesla has made it notoriously difficult to repair its cars, with parts being hard to obtain and software updates often locking out salvaged vehicles. Tesla argues that this is for safety reasons, but it also limits the ability of owners to maintain and repair their vehicles independently. 

Tesla frequently blocks attempted repairs and modifications by locking certain vehicle identification numbers (VINs) out of their software ecosystem. This means that if a car has been repaired or modified by a third party, it may be unable to access software updates or Tesla’s Supercharger network. This can severely limit the functionality and value of the vehicle.

One high-profile case involved a Tesla owner who modified their car into a custom pickup truck. Despite the extensive modifications, Tesla did not immediately lock out the vehicle, likely due to the public attention the project received. However, many other Tesla owners have reported their vehicles being blacklisted for far less significant modifications.

Tesla’s practices have also led to a thriving black market for parts and software hacks. Owners who find themselves locked out of Tesla’s ecosystem often turn to third-party vendors and hackers to regain functionality. While Tesla cites safety concerns, critics argue that the company’s restrictive policies are more about maintaining control and maximizing revenue from repairs and services.

## The Challenge of Compliance

Despite legislative victories, many companies engage in what can be termed "malicious compliance" – they comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. For instance, Hakko, a well-known manufacturer of soldering equipment, initially appeared to support the Right to Repair. They added a section to their website about repair manual access but later removed it, providing minimal documentation insufficient for practical repairs. This kind of token compliance is what repair advocates fear will become the norm.

## The Benefits of Right to Repair

The benefits of the Right to Repair extend beyond consumer convenience:
1. **Environmental Impact**: Reducing e-waste by repairing devices rather than discarding them.
2. **Economic Savings**: Allowing consumers to save money by fixing their own devices or choosing cheaper independent repair services.
3. **Empowerment**: Giving people the knowledge and tools to take control of their technology.

## Conclusion

The Right to Repair movement is a crucial response to a growing problem: the erosion of consumer rights in the face of corporate control. It seeks to restore a balance, ensuring that when we buy a product, we truly own it and can maintain and repair it as needed. As technology continues to evolve, maintaining this balance will be crucial for consumer rights, environmental sustainability, and economic fairness.

Despite legislative progress, continued advocacy and vigilance are necessary to ensure that these laws are implemented effectively. Consumers need to be aware of these issues and support businesses that genuinely embrace the Right to Repair. By advocating for better repair practices and legislative support, we can create an environment where technology serves us, not the other way around.

In conclusion, the Right to Repair is not just about fixing gadgets; it's about maintaining control over the products we own and ensuring a sustainable future. The fight for the Right to Repair is far from over, but with continued advocacy and support, we can hope for a future where consumers are empowered to take back control of their devices.

# Business Understanding in Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning projects often begin with excitement around data, algorithms, and models. However, without a solid business understanding, even the most accurate model can fail to deliver value. This blog post explores the essential first phase of any data science or machine learning initiative: business understanding.

## A. Understand the Business Problem

Every project starts with a problem. But in machine learning, it's easy to misinterpret a technical challenge as the main goal. The actual goal is to solve a real-world business problem. This step involves working closely with stakeholders to ask the right questions:

* What pain point are we trying to address?
* Who is affected by this issue?
* What is the impact of the problem on business metrics?

The goal here is to rephrase the business challenge in plain terms. For instance, "We are losing customers every quarter" becomes a starting point to explore retention issues.

## B. Define a High-Level Solution

Once the problem is well understood, outline a broad solution. At this stage, it's not about choosing between random forest or XGBoost. It's about identifying the kind of solution that could work.

* Is it a classification problem (e.g., predicting churn)?
* Is it a recommendation system (e.g., suggesting products)?
* Could it involve forecasting (e.g., sales for next quarter)?

The goal is to align on the kind of outcome the business expects before diving into data and models.

## C. Record Business Objectives

Next, document what the business wants to achieve. These objectives should be:

* Clear
* Actionable
* Measurable

Examples include:

* Reduce churn rate by 15%
* Improve customer conversion by 10%
* Automate invoice processing by 80%

Well-defined objectives provide direction and help assess progress later.

## D. Record Business Constraints

All projects have limitations. Understanding them early prevents roadblocks later. Common constraints include:

* Budget restrictions
* Tight deadlines
* Limited data availability
* Legal and regulatory boundaries
* Technical limitations of legacy systems

Constraints shape the feasibility of proposed solutions and help narrow the scope.

## E. Define Success Criteria

How will we know the project succeeded? Success criteria should connect both technical performance and business value. These can be grouped into three key categories:

### Business Success Criteria

* Tangible improvements to business KPIs (e.g., increased revenue, reduced churn, improved customer satisfaction)
* Adoption of the solution by business users
* Alignment with strategic priorities

### ML Success Criteria

* Accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics above a defined threshold
* Model robustness, fairness, and ability to generalize across use cases
* Efficient inference time and ease of deployment

### Economic Success Criteria

* Return on investment (ROI) exceeds cost of development and maintenance
* Cost savings through automation or improved efficiency
* Positive impact on profit margins or customer lifetime value

By setting success criteria early, teams create a shared understanding of what good looks like.

## Conclusion

Business understanding is not a formality. It is the foundation of every effective machine learning project. Without it, technical work risks missing the mark. By clearly defining the problem, solution direction, objectives, constraints, and success metrics, teams set themselves up for meaningful, measurable impact.

Start with business. Let data follow.

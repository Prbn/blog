### **Risk-Free Return**

**Risk-free return** refers to the theoretical return on an investment that carries **no risk** of financial loss. It is the return that investors expect from an asset that has **zero default risk**, meaning there is no uncertainty regarding its repayment or future value. Typically, the risk-free return is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of other, riskier investments.

### Characteristics of Risk-Free Return:
1. **No Risk**: The risk-free return is guaranteed, with no risk of losing the initial investment or missing expected payments.
2. **No Volatility**: The value of a risk-free asset does not fluctuate, ensuring a stable return over time.
3. **Safe Haven**: It is considered a safe investment, especially in times of market uncertainty.

### Common Examples of Risk-Free Assets:
- **U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)**: In many countries, the government’s short-term debt instruments (like U.S. Treasury bills) are considered risk-free because they are backed by the government, which is assumed to have zero risk of default. 
- **Government Bonds (Short-Term)**: Bonds issued by stable governments, especially those with shorter maturities, are considered risk-free or close to risk-free, depending on the country’s creditworthiness.

### Importance in Finance:
1. **Benchmark for Other Investments**: The risk-free rate is often used as a baseline when evaluating the performance of other investments. Any investment with risk is expected to generate a return higher than the risk-free rate to compensate for the additional risk.
2. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: In the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**, the risk-free rate is used to calculate the **required rate of return** on a risky asset by adjusting for its risk level relative to the market.
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: The Sharpe ratio, a common measure of risk-adjusted return, calculates the excess return of a portfolio above the risk-free rate, divided by its volatility.

### Example of Risk-Free Return:
- If the **U.S. Treasury Bill** is paying an annual interest rate of **2%**, then the risk-free return is **2%** per year. This means that if you invest in T-Bills, you can expect to earn 2% with no risk of loss over the holding period.

### Conclusion:
The **risk-free return** is the minimum return an investor can expect without assuming any risk. It plays a crucial role in financial models and investment decisions, helping investors assess how much additional return they need to justify taking on higher risk with riskier investments.

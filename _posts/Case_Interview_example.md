Below is an example of how to approach and solve the case interview scenario presented in the transcript you provided. This example mirrors the structure and thought process demonstrated by Eric in the dialogue, tailored to the specific problem of assessing whether FoodCo should acquire Smilk and if Smilk can achieve a 6X profitability increase in the U.S. alternative milk market over the next 5 years. I’ll walk through the steps as if I’m the candidate, providing a clear framework, analysis, and recommendation.

### Example Case Interview Response: FoodCo and Smilk Acquisition

**Interviewer Prompt:**  
"Our client, FoodCo, is a multi-billion-dollar company with leading brands across food categories. They’re interested in entering the alternative milk category—non-dairy, plant-based products like almond, oat, and soy milk—because they believe it’s growing quickly. They’ve partnered with Bain to evaluate acquiring Smilk, a company with an attractive profile: it’s doubled its profit each year for the past three years, holds 6% share of the alternative milk market (expected to grow to 8%), and operates in Europe and the U.S. FoodCo is focused only on the U.S. market for this analysis. The key question is whether Smilk can increase its U.S. profit by 6X over the next 5 years. How would you approach assessing this?"

---

#### Step 1: Clarify the Problem
"Thanks for the overview—I’m excited to dive in! Before I start, I’d like to ask a couple of clarifying questions. First, does Smilk’s portfolio cover all major alternative milk types—like almond, oat, soy—or are there gaps we should consider? Second, beyond the 6X profit goal, does FoodCo have any specific metrics or constraints, like a target ROI or acquisition budget, that I should keep in mind?"

**Interviewer Response:**  
"No significant portfolio gaps relevant to this case. For FoodCo, the focus is on whether the 6X profit growth is feasible, but they’re also interested in market share and the trade-offs between profit and share."

"Got it. So, we’re assessing if Smilk can 6X its U.S. profits in 5 years, while considering share dynamics. I’ll focus on that and take a moment to structure my thoughts."

---

#### Step 2: Announce and Justify the Framework
"To tackle this, I’ll break it into three main buckets:  
1. **The Alternative Milk Market:** I’ll evaluate its size, growth, and competitive dynamics to see if it supports Smilk’s profit ambitions. A strong market is key for any acquisition.  
2. **Smilk’s Internal Performance:** I’ll dig into Smilk’s financials—revenue, costs, margins—to understand how it’s doubled profits historically and whether that trajectory can scale to 6X in the U.S.  
3. **Deal-Specific Considerations and Risks:** This includes synergies with FoodCo, financing feasibility, and alternative entry options, plus qualitative factors like culture fit. These will affect ROI and practicality.  

I’ll start with a hypothesis: Smilk is a good acquisition, and the 6X target is achievable, but I’ll test that as we go. Does that approach sound good?"

**Interviewer:** "Yes, I like that. Why these buckets?"  
"The market bucket ensures the industry supports growth. Smilk’s performance tells us if it has the capability to hit 6X, and the third bucket covers execution risks and synergies—critical for FoodCo’s decision. Let’s begin with the market."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Market
"I’d like to understand the U.S. alternative milk market’s size and growth. Do we have data on its current size and projected growth over 5 years?"

**Interviewer:**  
"Here’s a slide: The total U.S. milk market today is $19 billion, with alternative milk at 11% share. In 5 years, the total market stays flat at $19.2 billion, but alternative milk grows to 20% share."

"Okay, let’s calculate. Today: $19B × 11% = $2.09B, call it $2.1B. In 5 years: $19.2B × 20% = $3.84B, roughly $4B. That’s nearly double—about a 14% CAGR [(4/2.1)^(1/5) ≈ 1.14]. That’s promising! The overall milk market is flat, but alternative milk’s growth suggests strong tailwinds for Smilk. Next, I’d look at Smilk’s share within this. With 6% today, that’s $2.1B × 6% = $126M in revenue. At 8% in 5 years, it’s $4B × 8% = $320M. That’s 2.5X revenue growth, but profit needs to hit 6X, so share alone won’t cut it—we’ll need margin improvements too. Can we explore Smilk’s financials?"

**Updated Hypothesis:** "The market looks attractive, but I’m skeptical 6X profit is feasible without big share or margin gains."

---

#### Step 4: Dive into Smilk’s Financials
"Great, what data do we have on Smilk’s U.S. operations—revenue, profit, margins?"

**Interviewer:**  
"Smilk’s total revenue today is $320M, with $120M from the U.S. (6% of the $2B market) and $200M from Europe. Total profit is $48M, with a 15% margin. U.S. margin is 10%, Europe’s is 18%."

"Interesting—U.S. profit is $120M × 10% = $12M, and Europe’s is $200M × 18% = $36M, which sums to $48M, confirming the total. So, the 6X target means U.S. profit must go from $12M to $72M. If share hits 8% in 5 years, revenue becomes $320M. At 10% margin, profit is $32M—2.7X, not 6X. Let’s test two scenarios:  
1. **Share Gain:** To hit $72M at 10% margin, revenue needs to be $720M. In a $4B market, that’s 18% share ($720M/$4B)—triple today’s 6%. That’s tough given Smilk’s plateauing share.  
2. **Margin Boost:** At $320M revenue (8% share), a $72M profit requires a 22.5% margin ($72M/$320M). Europe’s at 18%, so 23% is a stretch but possible with synergies—like FoodCo’s distribution scale reducing costs.  

A sensitivity table shows we need a mix of both. Can we see competitive data to assess share potential?"

#### Step 5: Assess Competitive Landscape
**Interviewer:**  
"Here’s a competitor view: Smilk’s share grew moderately but plateaued at 6%. Large SnackCo leads; the market’s crowded."

"This suggests share gains beyond 8% are challenging—competitors like Large SnackCo are entrenched. Smilk’s small but has room to grow awareness (it’s low now) and leverage its premium brand (fun, delicious). Pricing could help—raising it might boost margins without heavy share fights. What’s Smilk’s pricing versus competitors?"

**Interviewer:**  
"Smilk’s mid-tier; premium brands charge more, but some see pushback."

"That’s promising—pricing up could lift margins toward 20%, especially with FoodCo’s scale. Synergies might cut costs too, like logistics or sourcing."

---

#### Step 6: Synthesize and Recommend
"Let’s wrap up. I recommend FoodCo acquire Smilk for three reasons:  
1. **Market Growth:** Alternative milk doubles from $2.1B to $4B in 5 years—strong tailwinds.  
2. **Smilk’s Potential:** It’s doubled profits yearly, has a premium brand, and low awareness offers upside.  
3. **Synergies:** FoodCo’s scale could boost U.S. margins from 10% toward Europe’s 18%, maybe 20%.  

On the 6X goal—$12M to $72M—it’s ambitious. At 8% share, $320M revenue with a 22.5% margin gets us there, but that assumes big margin gains and some share growth. Realistically, 15-20% margins (via synergies) and 10% share (via pricing/awareness) yield $40-50M—4X, not 6X. Risks include competition and pricing resistance.  

**Next Steps:** Test pricing pilots for willingness-to-pay and quantify FoodCo’s synergy potential. Smilk’s a solid buy, but we might negotiate down if 6X seems optimistic. Thoughts?"

**Interviewer:** "That’s thorough—nice work!"

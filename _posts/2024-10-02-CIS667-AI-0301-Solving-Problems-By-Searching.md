# Problem-solving agents

When the correct action to take is not immediately obvious, an agent may need to to plan ahead: to consider a sequence of actions that form a path to a goal state. Such an agent is called a problem-solving agent, and the computational process it undertakes is called search

Problem-solving agents use atomic representations. Where, states of the world are considered as wholes, with no internal structure visible to the problem-solving algorithms. 
Agents that use factored or structured representations of states are called planning agents

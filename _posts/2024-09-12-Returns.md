# Realized Return

**Realized Return** is the actual return that an investor earns on an investment over a specific period, based on the changes in the investment’s value, including both price appreciation (or depreciation) and income (such as dividends or interest). Unlike **expected return**, which is a forecast of potential future returns, realized return reflects what has actually occurred.

### Formula for Realized Return:

$$
\text{Realized Return} = \frac{(P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{begin}}) + D}{P_{\text{begin}}}
$$

Where:
- $P_{\text{end}}$: Price of the asset at the end of the period.
- $P_{\text{begin}}$: Price of the asset at the beginning of the period.
- $D$: Dividends or other income received during the period.

### Key Points:
- **Price Changes:** Realized return includes capital gains or losses, which reflect the changes in the market price of the asset over the holding period.
- **Income:** Dividends (for stocks) or interest (for bonds) are included as part of the return.
- **Past Performance:** It measures historical performance and is used to evaluate how well an investment has performed relative to other investments or benchmarks.

### Example:

Suppose an investor buys a stock for $100, holds it for a year, and sells it for $120. During this time, the stock also paid $5 in dividends. The realized return would be calculated as:

$$
\text{Realized Return} = \frac{(120 - 100) + 5}{100} = \frac{25}{100} = 25\%
$$

This means the investor earned a 25% return on the investment over the holding period.

### Importance of Realized Return:
- **Performance Evaluation**: Investors use realized returns to assess how well their investments performed compared to initial expectations or benchmarks.
- **Investment Strategy Adjustment**: After reviewing realized returns, investors may adjust their strategies based on actual performance, such as reallocating assets or changing portfolios.
- **Tax Considerations**: Realized returns trigger tax obligations, such as capital gains tax on the profit from the sale of an asset.

### Limitations:
- **Historical Nature**: Realized return reflects past performance, which may not necessarily indicate future performance. Just because an asset had a high realized return in the past doesn’t guarantee it will continue to perform well.
- **Impact of Timing**: The realized return can vary significantly based on the period over which the investment was held, meaning returns can fluctuate based on market conditions at the time of sale.

# Holding-Period Return (HPR)

**Holding-Period Return (HPR)** is a measure of the total return an investor earns from holding an asset or investment over a specific period of time. It takes into account all sources of income and capital gains (or losses) during the holding period, including interest, dividends, and price changes. The holding period could be any length of time, such as days, months, or years.

### Formula for Holding-Period Return:

$$
\text{HPR} = \frac{(P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{begin}}) + D}{P_{\text{begin}}}
$$

Where:
- $P_{\text{end}}$: Price of the asset at the end of the holding period.
- $P_{\text{\begin}}$: Price of the asset at the beginning of the holding period.
- $D$: Dividends or income received during the holding period.

### Key Points:

1. **Price Appreciation:** The change in the asset's value over the holding period.
2. **Dividends/Income:** Any income earned from holding the asset, such as dividends from stocks or interest from bonds.

### Example:

Imagine you bought a stock for $100 and held it for one year. After one year, the stock's price rises to $120, and you also received $5 in dividends during that time. The Holding-Period Return would be:

$$
\text{HPR} = \frac{(120 - 100) + 5}{100} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\%
$$

This means the total return for the holding period is 25%, which includes both the price appreciation and the dividend income.

### Advantages of HPR:
- **Flexible Time Period:** It can be used for any length of time, from a few days to several years.
- **Simple Calculation:** It provides a straightforward measure of total return, accounting for both capital gains and income.

### Limitations:
- **Not Annualized:** HPR does not account for the time dimension unless explicitly annualized. For comparing investments over different time periods, you would need to annualize the HPR.
- **Ignores Compounding:** It does not consider compounding effects, especially over long time periods.

### Annualizing Holding-Period Return:
If you want to annualize the HPR (to compare returns over different periods), the formula is:

$$
\text{Annualized HPR} = (1 + \text{HPR})^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
$$
Where $n$ is the number of years in the holding period.

For example, if you have an HPR of 25% over two years:

$$
\text{Annualized HPR} = (1 + 0.25)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \approx 0.118 or 11.8\%
$$

**Expected Return** is the anticipated or forecasted return on an investment, based on historical data, probability distribution of possible outcomes, or economic factors. It represents the average return an investor can expect to earn over time, assuming all possible outcomes are known and weighted by their likelihood of occurring.

### Formula for Expected Return:

The expected return is calculated as the weighted average of the potential returns, where each return is weighted by its probability of occurring. The formula is:

$$
\text{Expected Return (ER)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \times R_i
$$

Where:
- $P_i$ = Probability of return $i$ occurring.
- $R_i$ = Return in scenario $i$.
- $n$ = Total number of possible scenarios or outcomes.

### Example:

Assume an investor is considering investing in a stock, and based on historical data or an economic model, the investor estimates the following outcomes:

| Scenario | Return (%) | Probability (%) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Good     | 20         | 30              |
| Average  | 10         | 50              |
| Bad      | -5         | 20              |

The expected return is calculated by multiplying the return of each scenario by its probability and summing the results:

$$
\text{Expected Return} = (0.30 \times 20) + (0.50 \times 10) + (0.20 \times -5)
$$

$$
\text{Expected Return} = 6 + 5 - 1 = 10\%
$$

This means that, based on the probabilities and possible outcomes, the investor expects a 10% return on the investment over time.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Not a Guaranteed Return:** The expected return is an average estimate based on probabilities and does not guarantee the actual return on an investment.
2. **Uncertainty and Risk:** Expected returns are based on assumptions and estimations about the future, so the actual return can deviate from the expected return, which introduces risk.
3. **Portfolio Expected Return:** The expected return of a portfolio can be calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets in the portfolio. The weights correspond to the proportion of the portfolio invested in each asset.

$$
\text{Portfolio Expected Return} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times ER_i
$$
Where:
- $w_i$ = Weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio.
- $ER_i$ = Expected return of asset $i$.

### Importance of Expected Return:

- **Investment Decisions:** Investors use expected returns to compare different investment options and choose the ones that best align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Expected return is often used alongside risk measures like standard deviation or beta to evaluate the trade-off between risk and reward.
- **Asset Pricing Models:** Expected return is a key concept in models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which estimates the return of an asset based on its risk relative to the market.

### Limitations:

- **Estimation Error:** Expected returns are based on forecasts or historical data, which may not accurately predict future performance.
- **Assumes Known Probabilities:** The formula assumes that the probabilities of different outcomes are known, which may not always be the case in real-world investments.

### Realized Return vs. Expected Return:

- **Realized Return**: This is what the investor actually earned, reflecting past performance. It is based on actual outcomes and is known once the investment is sold or the time period is completed.
- **Expected Return**: This is an estimate of future performance, based on probabilities or assumptions. It is theoretical and subject to uncertainty.

# Excess Return

**Excess Return** refers to the return generated by an investment that exceeds the return of a benchmark or risk-free rate. It represents the additional reward an investor earns for taking on more risk than what is considered "risk-free," such as investing in U.S. Treasury bonds. Excess return is a key concept in evaluating investment performance, particularly in determining how much additional return an investor earns for taking on risk compared to safer alternatives.

### Formula for Excess Return:

$$
\text{Excess Return} = \text{Actual Return} - \text{Benchmark Return}
$$

or

$$
\text{Excess Return} = \text{Actual Return} - \text{Risk-free Rate}
$$

Where:
- **Actual Return** is the return generated by the investment.
- **Benchmark Return** is the return of a comparable index or asset used as a reference.
- **Risk-free Rate** is the return from a risk-free investment, typically U.S. Treasury bills or bonds, considered the safest and with the lowest risk.

or

Excess Returns is percentage unit defined as 
$$
R_{m,t} − r_{f,t}
$$

Where:
- $R_{m,t}$ is value weighted portfolio realized returns
  $$
  R_{m,t} = R_{Stock_1,t}*W_{Stock_1,t-1} + R_{Stock_2,t}*W_{Stock_2,t-1} + .....
  $$
  
  Where:
  - $W_{Stock_1,t-1} = \frac{\text{Stock}_{1}\text{market cap}}{\text{Total market cap}}$
  - $\text{market cap} = \text{price}\_{1} \times \text{number of share}_{1}$
  - $W_{Stock_1,{t-1}} + W_{Stock_3,{t-1}} + ..... = 1$

    The excess returns on the market, value-weight returns of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ that have a CRSP share code of 10 or 11.

    The market cap is take on $t-1$ as it is calculated for the day of trading


### Key Points:

1. **Excess Return Over Benchmark:** This is used when comparing the performance of a portfolio or fund against a market index (e.g., the S&P 500). If the investment outperforms the index, the difference is the excess return.
   - **Example:** If an investor’s portfolio returns 12% in a year, while the S&P 500 index returns 8%, the excess return over the benchmark is 4%.

2. **Excess Return Over Risk-Free Rate:** This is often used to evaluate whether the additional risk taken by an investor has paid off. The Sharpe ratio, for example, is based on excess return over the risk-free rate, adjusted for volatility.
   - **Example:** If an investment has a return of 10% and the risk-free rate is 3%, the excess return is 7%.

### Importance of Excess Return:

1. **Performance Evaluation:** Excess return allows investors to measure how well their investments are performing relative to a standard, helping them assess whether the risk they are taking is justified by the reward.
   
2. **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** When calculating risk-adjusted metrics like the Sharpe ratio, excess return is used to understand how much return is generated per unit of risk beyond the risk-free rate.

3. **Benchmarking:** Excess return helps in comparing actively managed portfolios with passive index funds or benchmarks. A positive excess return suggests the manager has added value; a negative excess return indicates underperformance.

### Examples:

1. **Excess Return vs. Benchmark:**
   - Portfolio return: 15%
   - Benchmark return: 10%
   
   **Excess return:**  
   $$
   15\% - 10\% = 5\%
   $$
   This indicates that the portfolio outperformed the benchmark by 5%.

2. **Excess Return vs. Risk-Free Rate:**
   - Portfolio return: 8%
   - Risk-free rate: 3%
   
   **Excess return:**  
   $$
   8\% - 3\% = 5\%
   $$
   This means the portfolio earned 5/% more than a risk-free investment.

### Applications:

- **Active Management Evaluation:** Investors use excess return to determine if actively managed funds are worth the fees compared to passive investments.
- **Risk Assessment:** Helps in understanding whether the risk taken by investing in volatile assets like stocks or corporate bonds is compensated by higher returns compared to low-risk assets like government bonds.

### Limitations:

- **Market Conditions:** Excess returns may vary widely depending on market conditions. Outperformance in one year does not guarantee consistent excess returns.
- **Risk-Free Rate Changes:** Fluctuations in the risk-free rate (e.g., interest rate changes) can impact the calculation of excess return, particularly in fixed-income investments.

# Risk Premium

**Risk Premium** (also known as **Risk Reward** or **Risk Compensation**) refers to the additional return an investor expects to earn for taking on a higher level of risk compared to a risk-free investment. It is the extra compensation an investor receives for assuming the uncertainty and potential for loss associated with riskier investments, such as stocks or corporate bonds, over safer, low-risk assets like government bonds or Treasury bills.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Risk-Free Rate:** This is the return on an investment with zero risk, typically represented by government securities such as U.S. Treasury bills. The risk-free rate serves as the baseline for comparing returns from riskier investments.

2. **Risk Premium:** The difference between the expected return of a risky investment and the risk-free rate. It compensates investors for the risk of holding assets that can fluctuate in value.

### Formula for Risk Premium:

$$
\text{Risk Premium} = \text{Expected Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}
$$

Where:
- **Expected Return** is the anticipated return on the risky asset.
- **Risk-Free Rate** is the return on a risk-free investment (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds).

### Example:

Suppose an investor is considering two investment options:
- A **risk-free** asset like a U.S. Treasury bill with an annual return of 2%.
- A **riskier stock** with an expected annual return of 8%.

The **risk premium** for the stock would be:

$$
\text{Risk Premium} = 8\% - 2\% = 6\%
$$

This means the investor expects to earn an additional 6% for taking on the risk associated with the stock investment, compared to the risk-free Treasury bill.

### Types of Risk Premium:

1. **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** This is the additional return that investors expect from investing in stocks rather than risk-free securities. The equity risk premium compensates investors for the higher volatility and uncertainty associated with stocks.
   - **Example:** If the stock market is expected to return 10% and the risk-free rate is 3%, the equity risk premium is 7%.

2. **Credit Risk Premium:** This is the additional return required for taking on the credit risk associated with bonds issued by corporations or entities that may default, compared to risk-free government bonds.
   - **Example:** If a corporate bond offers 5% and a government bond offers 2%, the credit risk premium is 3%.

3. **Inflation Risk Premium:** The extra return investors demand to compensate for the risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of their returns.
   - **Example:** A bond may offer a higher yield to compensate for the potential impact of future inflation.

4. **Liquidity Risk Premium:** This compensates investors for holding assets that are not easily tradable or may take time to sell without a significant price impact.
   - **Example:** Real estate or small-cap stocks may offer higher returns due to their lower liquidity compared to more liquid assets like large-cap stocks or government bonds.

### Importance of Risk Premium:

1. **Investment Decision-Making:** Risk premium helps investors determine whether the potential return of a risky asset justifies the additional risk. It guides them in deciding how to allocate their portfolio between safe and risky investments.
   
2. **Asset Pricing Models:** The concept of risk premium is central to models like the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**, which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its systematic risk relative to the market. In CAPM, the **market risk premium** is used to estimate the return on risky assets.

3. **Assessing Compensation for Risk:** Investors use risk premium to ensure they are being compensated adequately for taking on additional risk. If the premium is not high enough to justify the risk, they may opt for safer investments.

### Risk Premium in CAPM:

In the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**, the risk premium is a key component:

$$
\text{Expected Return} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \beta \times (\text{Market Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate})
$$

Where:
- $\beta$ measures the sensitivity of the asset to market risk.
- $(\text{Market Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate})$ is the **market risk premium**.

### Limitations:
- **Market Conditions:** Risk premiums can change with market conditions, such as increased uncertainty during economic downturns, which can make it difficult to accurately estimate future returns.
- **Subjectivity in Expected Return:** The expected return is based on forecasts, which can be uncertain, and assumptions about risk premiums may vary among different investors.

### Conclusion:

- **Realized Return** is a key metric for understanding how much an investor actually earned (or lost) on an investment during a specific period, taking into account both price changes and income earned.
- **Holding-Period Return** is a valuable tool for measuring the performance of an investment over a specific period, considering both income and capital gains. However, it needs to be annualized for comparing investments with different time frames.
- **Expected Return** provides an estimate of what an investor might earn on an investment over time, helping in decision-making and portfolio planning. However, it should be interpreted with caution, as it does not account for actual uncertainty or guarantee future performance.
- **Excess Return** is a key performance metric that helps investors gauge how much additional return they are earning over a benchmark or risk-free rate, allowing them to assess whether the risks they are taking are justified by the rewards they receive.
- **Risk premium** is a fundamental concept in finance that compensates investors for the risk they take by investing in assets that are not risk-free. It helps guide investment choices, offering higher potential rewards for higher risks. Understanding the risk premium helps investors weigh whether the expected returns are worth the risk they are taking, contributing to better portfolio management and asset allocation strategies.

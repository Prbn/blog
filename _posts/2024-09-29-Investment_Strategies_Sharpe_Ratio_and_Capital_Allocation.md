# Understanding the Sharpe Ratio and Capital Allocation: A Guide to Risk-Adjusted Returns

## Introduction

In the world of investing, assessing the performance of a portfolio isn't just about looking at returns. Investors need to consider the risk they are taking to achieve those returns. This is where the **Sharpe ratio** comes in—a widely used metric that measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment or portfolio. By comparing the excess return of a portfolio (returns above the risk-free rate) to its volatility (risk), the Sharpe ratio tells us how efficiently a portfolio is compensating for the risks it takes.

In this post, we’ll break down the Sharpe ratio, explore its relationship with wealth allocation between risky and risk-free assets, and explain how the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) fits into this equation. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of how the Sharpe ratio helps investors make more informed decisions about risk and return.

## What is the Sharpe Ratio?

The **Sharpe ratio** is a measure of the excess return earned per unit of risk. It’s calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R_P) - r_F}{\sigma_P}
$$

Where:
- $E(R_P)$ is the expected return of the **risky asset** or portfolio.
- $r_F$ is the **risk-free rate**.
- $\sigma_P$ is the **volatility** (standard deviation) of the risky asset or portfolio.

A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that the portfolio is delivering more return per unit of risk, making it more attractive from a risk-adjusted perspective.

## Sharpe Ratio and Wealth Allocation

A key insight into portfolio management is that the **Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio** remains **constant** when an investor allocates wealth between a risky asset and a risk-free asset. In other words, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio is equal to the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset, regardless of how much of the portfolio is allocated to the risky asset versus the risk-free asset.

## Why Doesn't the Sharpe Ratio Change with Allocation?

There are two main reasons why the Sharpe ratio remains unchanged when combining risky and risk-free assets:

1. **Sharpe Ratio of a Risk-Free Asset**: The Sharpe ratio of a risk-free asset is **zero** because its return is equal to $r_F$, and its volatility ($\sigma$) is zero. Therefore, risk-free assets do not contribute to risk-adjusted returns.
   
2. **Combination of Risk-Free and Risky Assets**: When a portfolio consists of both risk-free and risky assets, it lies along the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**, which represents the trade-off between risk and return. The Sharpe ratio of any point on this line is the same as that of the risky asset, no matter how much wealth is allocated to each asset.

## The Complete Portfolio: Formula Breakdown

The expected return of a complete portfolio that combines both risky and risk-free assets is:

$$
E(R_C) = y_0 \times E(R_P) + (1 - y_0) \times r_F
$$

Where:
- $y_0$ is the proportion of wealth allocated to the risky asset.
- $E(R_P)$ is the expected return of the risky asset.
- $r_F$ is the return of the risk-free asset.

The volatility of the complete portfolio is given by:

$$
\sigma_C = y_0 \times \sigma_P
$$

Where $\sigma_P$ is the volatility of the risky asset.

Finally, the Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio is:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio of Complete Portfolio} = \frac{E(R_C) - r_F}{\sigma_C}
$$

Substituting the formulas for $E(R_C)$ and $\sigma_C$:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio of Complete Portfolio} = \frac{y_0 \times (E(R_P) - r_F)}{y_0 \times \sigma_P}
$$

By simplifying this expression, we arrive at:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio of Complete Portfolio} = \frac{E(R_P) - r_F}{\sigma_P}
$$

Thus, the Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio is the same as the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset. The wealth allocation ($y_0$) cancels out, confirming that changes in allocation between risky and risk-free assets do not affect the Sharpe ratio.

## Graphical Interpretation: The Capital Allocation Line (CAL)

The **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** is a graphical representation of the trade-off between risk and return for portfolios that combine a risky asset with a risk-free asset. The slope of the CAL is the **Sharpe ratio** of the risky portfolio, and all points along the line—regardless of allocation—share the same Sharpe ratio.

- The **x-axis** represents risk (volatility), while the **y-axis** represents expected return.
- By moving along the CAL, investors adjust their exposure to risk, but the **Sharpe ratio remains constant**. This reflects that no matter the mix of risky and risk-free assets, the amount of excess return per unit of risk stays the same.

## Opinion: The Power of the Sharpe Ratio in Portfolio Management

In my view, the Sharpe ratio is one of the most valuable tools for evaluating investment performance. By focusing on risk-adjusted returns, it provides a more comprehensive assessment than simply looking at raw returns. The fact that the Sharpe ratio remains constant along the CAL is a key insight for investors, as it allows them to confidently adjust their portfolio's risk exposure without worrying about deteriorating risk efficiency.

For long-term investors, understanding the Sharpe ratio helps in making smarter decisions about how to allocate wealth between risky and risk-free assets. It also reinforces the importance of balancing risk and return, which is crucial for building a resilient portfolio that can weather market fluctuations.

## Conclusion

The **Sharpe ratio** is a powerful metric that provides insights into how well an investment or portfolio compensates for risk. Whether you're fully invested in risky assets or balancing your portfolio with risk-free assets, the Sharpe ratio remains a constant measure of risk-adjusted return.

Key takeaways:
- The Sharpe ratio remains **unchanged** regardless of how you allocate your wealth between risky and risk-free assets.
- The slope of the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** is the Sharpe ratio, and every portfolio along the CAL shares this same risk-adjusted return efficiency.
- While the **expected return** and **volatility** of a portfolio may change as you adjust allocations, the Sharpe ratio—an indicator of excess return per unit of risk—remains steady.

## Summary

- The **Sharpe ratio** measures the excess return earned per unit of risk.
- Combining a **risky asset** with a **risk-free asset** does not change the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio—it remains equal to the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset.
- The **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** represents the risk-return trade-off for a mix of risky and risk-free assets, with the Sharpe ratio as its slope.
- Investors can use the Sharpe ratio to make informed decisions about risk-adjusted returns, ensuring they are adequately compensated for the risks they take.

Different types of returns and their comparisons:

### 1. **Realized Return:**
   - **Definition:** The actual return an investor earns on an investment over a specific time period. It includes both capital gains (or losses) and income (like dividends or interest) received during that time.
   - **Formula:**
     $$
     \text{Realized Return} = \frac{(P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{begin}}) + D}{P_{\text{begin}}}
     $$
     Where $P_{\text{end}}$ is the price at the end of the period, $P_{\text{begin}}$ is the price at the start, and $D$ is any income earned.
   - **Use Case:** Evaluating the actual historical performance of an investment.
   - **Example:** If you bought a stock at $100, sold it at $120, and received $5 in dividends, the realized return is 25%.

### 2. **Holding-Period Return (HPR):**
  - **Definition:** HPR measures the total return earned from holding an investment over a specific period of time, which includes price changes and any income received (e.g., dividends).
  - **Formula:**
   $$
   \text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Ending Value} + \text{Income Received} - \text{Beginning Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}
   $$
  - **Use Case:** Useful for calculating returns over any defined period, whether short-term (days) or long-term (years).
  - **Example:** Similar to realized return, if a stock was held for one year with a 20% price increase and $5 dividends, the HPR would be the return over that holding period.
  - **Purpose**: To assess the overall performance of an investment over the period it was held.
  - **Focus**: It is a historical measure that looks at actual returns over a given period.
  - **Timeframe**: Reflects the return over the entire holding period, which can vary (days, months, years).

### 3. **Expected Return:**
   - **Definition:** The estimated or forecasted return on an investment, based on probabilities of various outcomes. It represents the average return an investor expects to earn over time.
   - **Formula:**
     $$
     \text{Expected Return (ER)} = \sum P_i \times R_i
     $$
     Where $P_i$ is the probability of return $R_i$ occurring.
   - **Use Case:** Helps in predicting potential future returns based on scenarios and probabilities.
   - **Example:** If a stock has a 50% chance of returning 10%, a 30% chance of returning 5%, and a 20% chance of returning -2%, the expected return would be calculated as an average of these outcomes.

### 4. **Excess Return:**
  - **Definition:** The return generated by an investment that exceeds the return of a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500) or the risk-free rate (e.g., U.S. Treasury bills).
  - **Formula:**
   $$
   \text{Excess Return} = \text{Actual Return} - \text{Benchmark Return}
   $$
  
   or
  
   $$
   \text{Excess Return} = \text{Actual Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}
   $$
  - **Use Case:** Useful for comparing the performance of a portfolio or investment against a standard, especially when evaluating active management.
  - **Example:** If your portfolio returns 12% while the S&P 500 index returns 8%, your excess return is 4%.
  - **Purpose**: To evaluate the performance of an investment relative to a risk-free benchmark, highlighting the additional return earned for taking on risk.
  - **Focus**: A backward-looking measure that focuses on the additional return achieved over the risk-free rate.
  - **Timeframe**: Can be calculated for any period, but often annualized.




### 5. **Risk Premium:**
  - **Definition**: Risk premium is the expected extra return investors require for taking on the risk of a risky asset compared to a risk-free asset. It represents the compensation for bearing additional risk.
  - **Formula:**
   $$
   \text{Risk Premium} = \text{Expected Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}
   $$
  - **Use Case:** Evaluates whether the additional risk an investor takes is justified by the higher returns, and helps guide asset allocation.
  - **Example:** If a stockâ€™s expected return is 10% and the risk-free rate is 3%, the risk premium is 7%.
  - **Purpose**: To estimate the additional return needed to compensate for the risk of an investment.
  - **Focus**: A forward-looking measure that represents the required compensation for risk.
  - **Timeframe**: Typically used for expected future returns, often annualized.

This table provides a clear, structured view of these five financial concepts, explaining their formulas, use cases, examples, and the distinction between past-focused and future-focused returns.

### **Key Differences:**

- **Measurement vs. Expectation**: 
  - **HPR** measures actual, realized returns over a specific period.
  - **Excess Return** measures the realized performance relative to a risk-free benchmark.
  - **Risk Premium** is about the expected or required return above the risk-free rate to compensate for risk.

- **Backward vs. Forward Looking**:
  - **HPR** and **Excess Return** are backward-looking measures based on historical data.
  - **Risk Premium** is forward-looking, representing expectations of future returns.

- **Focus on Risk-Free Rate**:
  - **Excess Return** and **Risk Premium** both compare to the risk-free rate, but **HPR** does not; it simply reflects total return over the holding period.

- **Purpose**:
  - **HPR** is used for assessing past performance over a specific holding period.
  - **Excess Return** evaluates the return relative to a low-risk benchmark.
  - **Risk Premium** helps investors decide if the expected reward justifies the risk involved in an investment.

Understanding these differences helps investors evaluate past performance (HPR, Excess Return) and align expectations with the required compensation for risk (Risk Premium).

### Summary:

- **Realized Return**: The actual return earned on an investment over a period, including price changes and income. It looks at past performance and is used to evaluate historical returns.
- **Holding-Period Return (HPR)**: The total return over a specific period an investment is held, considering both capital gains and income. It measures overall performance over any defined time period (days, months, or years).
- **Expected Return**: The forecasted or anticipated return based on the probability of different outcomes. It is forward-looking and used to estimate potential future returns.
- **Excess Return**: The return above a benchmark or risk-free rate. It compares actual investment performance to a low-risk alternative and evaluates how much additional return was earned for taking on risk.
- **Risk Premium**: The extra return expected for taking on risk compared to a risk-free asset. It is future-oriented, showing the compensation required for assuming higher risk.

### Conclusion:

- **Realized Return** and **Holding-Period Return** are actual returns measured over a specific time frame.
- **Expected Return** estimates future returns based on probabilities.
- **Excess Return** compares actual returns against benchmarks or risk-free rates to assess performance.
- **Risk Premium** is the extra return investors demand for taking on higher risk compared to a risk-free investment.

In essence, **Realized Return** and **HPR** reflect past returns, while **Expected Return**, **Excess Return**, and **Risk Premium** provide insights into future expectations and risk-adjusted performance.

These terms are essential in evaluating and comparing the performance of investments and understanding how much risk an investor is taking relative to the reward they receive.

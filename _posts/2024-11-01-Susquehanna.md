# **Susquehanna International Group: Elevating Trading Acumen Through Poker Training**

In the high-stakes world of financial trading, where decisions are made in fractions of a second and outcomes hinge on calculated risks, Susquehanna International Group (SIG) has adopted an unconventional yet effective training method: poker. This global quantitative trading firm integrates poker into its training programs to enhance traders' decision-making skills under uncertainty. 

**Poker as a Training Tool**

At SIG, new traders undergo a 10-week training program that includes at least 100 hours of poker. This isn't merely for recreation; it's a deliberate strategy to teach decision-making with imperfect information. Poker requires players to assess probabilities, manage risks, and make strategic decisions—skills directly applicable to trading. As SIG's associate director, Todd Simkin, notes, "It's a very good model for making decisions with imperfect information."

**The Founders' Vision**

SIG's founders, including Jeff Yass, who placed 12th at a 2013 World Series of Poker tournament, believe that poker mirrors the challenges of trading. Both fields demand quick thinking, risk assessment, and the ability to act decisively under pressure. Yass and his colleagues have cultivated a culture where poker isn't just a game but a critical component of professional development.

**Beyond the Trading Floor**

The emphasis on poker extends beyond training sessions. SIG hosts annual poker tournaments involving thousands of employees, from traders to technologists. These events foster a culture of strategic thinking and camaraderie. Notably, at least three SIG employees have achieved wins at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, underscoring the firm's commitment to excellence both in trading and at the poker table.

**A Broader Industry Trend**

SIG's integration of poker into its training reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where firms recognize the parallels between poker and trading. Other industry leaders, such as Steve Cohen of Point72 and Carl Icahn of Icahn Enterprises, are known to engage in poker, highlighting its value in honing decision-making skills.

## **Conclusion**

By embedding poker into its training programs, Susquehanna International Group equips its traders with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of financial markets. This innovative approach underscores the importance of strategic thinking, risk management, and decision-making under uncertainty—core competencies for success in both poker and trading.

# Problem-Solving Agents

**Problem-solving agents** are a type of intelligent agents designed to find sequences of actions that achieve a specific goal. Unlike *simple reflex agents* that react to the current state of the world, problem-solving agents **plan ahead** by simulating actions and their consequences before deciding what to do. These agents use **search algorithms** to explore possible future states and find a path to the desired goal.

## **Key Characteristics of Problem-Solving Agents:**

1. **Goal-Oriented**:
   - Problem-solving agents work towards achieving a predefined goal. The agent formulates this goal and uses it to guide its behavior, limiting the actions it considers to those that help achieve the goal.

2. **Search-Based**:
   - The agent doesn't take action immediately but instead **searches** through potential sequences of actions, simulating future states to find a solution. This process is often referred to as **offline problem-solving**, as the agent thinks before acting.

3. **Atomic Representations**:
   - Problem-solving agents typically represent the world in a simple way, where each state is treated as an indivisible whole (atomic). The internal structure of the states is not visible to the problem-solving algorithms, which treat each state as a unit and focus on transitions between these states.

## **Steps in Problem Solving:**

The **problem-solving process** for these agents can be broken down into four key phases:

1. **Goal Formulation**:
   - It is the process where an agent defines its objective or desired outcome in a problem-solving task.
   - The agent defines what it wants to achieve. A goal is a specific condition or set of conditions that the agent wants to bring about. For example, if an agent is tasked with cleaning a room, the goal might be "no dirt left in the room."

2. **Problem Formulation**:
   - It is the process by which an agent defines the structure of a problem it needs to solve to achieve a goal.
   - The agent creates an abstract model of the problem that includes:
     - **Initial state**: The starting point.
     - **Goal state(s)**: The conditions the agent is trying to reach.
     - **Actions**: The moves the agent can make to transition between states.
     - **Transition model**: A description of how each action changes the state.
     - **Action costs**: The costs associated with each action (if applicable).

3. **Search for a Solution**:
   - Before taking any action, the agent **searches** through the possible action sequences to find a path from the initial state to the goal state. The result is a solution: a **path** (sequence of actions) that leads from the initial state to the goal.
   - It evaluates the possible actions it can take in the current state, sees where each action leads, and continues exploring until it finds a path to the goal.
   - The agent explores different paths of actions that might solve the problem.
   - The agent can use search algorithms to find solutions, such as:
       - *Breadth-First Search (BFS):* Looks at all possible actions at the current level before moving deeper.
       - *Depth-First Search (DFS):* Explores as deeply as possible before backtracking.
       - *A\*:* Combines the path cost with an estimate of how close the agent is to the goal, making it more efficient.
  
4. **Execution**:
   - Once a solution (sequence of actions) is found, the agent executes the actions one by one in the real world to achieve the goal.
   - The agent performs each action in the sequence that it identified during the search process.
   - As it executes each action, it updates its understanding of the environment (because the real world might introduce changes or unexpected obstacles).
   - Execution is where the agent applies its solution to the real world. This step is critical because, even though the agent has found a solution in its model of the world, it must now act and adjust if the environment changes.

These four steps—goal formulation, problem formulation, search for a solution, and execution—help problem-solving agents approach complex tasks in a structured way. The agent doesn't act haphazardly but instead thinks ahead, considers all options, and only then takes action based on a well-considered plan.

## **Structure of a Simple Problem-Solving Agent:**

A typical problem-solving agent follows this structure (in pseudocode):

```pseudocode
function Simple-Problem-Solving-Agent(percept) returns an action
  static: seq, an action sequence, initially empty
          state, current world state
          goal, a goal (initially null)
          problem, a problem formulation
          
  state ← Update-State(state, percept)
  
  if seq is empty then
      goal ← Formulate-Goal(state)
      problem ← Formulate-Problem(state, goal)
      seq ← Search(problem)  // find a sequence of actions to solve the problem
  
  action ← Recommendation(seq, state)  // pick the next action
  seq ← Remainder(seq, state)  // update the sequence to remove the action just taken
  return action
```
**Note: This pseudocode represents a simple problem-solving agent that reacts based on its perception of the environment, formulates goals and problems, and searches for solutions.**

#### **Workflow:**/
**Update State:** The agent updates its internal state based on percepts./
**Plan:** If no plan exists, the agent formulates a goal and problem, then searches for a sequence of actions to achieve the goal./
**Action Selection:** The agent selects an action from the action sequence based on the current state./
**Execution:** The agent executes the action and removes it from the action sequence./
**Repeat:** This process continues until the goal is achieved or no more actions are available.

## **Agent's Workflow: Simple Problem-Solving Agent**

A **problem-solving agent** follows a structured workflow to navigate its environment, process information, and take actions that lead to achieving a predefined goal. The process is systematic, with the agent simulating various possibilities before taking action, allowing it to make rational decisions. Below is a breakdown of the key phases in the workflow of a simple problem-solving agent:

### **1. Perception and State Update**
At the core of the agent's workflow is the ability to **sense its environment**. Through sensors or data inputs, the agent gathers information about the current state of the world. This information is crucial because it forms the foundation for the agent's decision-making process. Once the perception is gathered, the agent **updates its internal state** to reflect the most current and accurate representation of the environment.

### **2. Goal Formulation**
Once the agent has an understanding of the environment, it needs to establish a goal. **Goal formulation** is the process where the agent identifies the desired end state it wants to achieve. This goal directs the agent's behavior by focusing on specific actions that will help accomplish the objective.

### **3. Problem Formulation**
In this phase, the agent abstracts the situation into a **problem formulation**, where it defines:
- The **initial state**: Where it currently stands.
- The **goal state**: What it aims to achieve.
- The **available actions**: The possible moves it can make to transition between states.
- The **transition model**: Describing what happens when the agent performs an action and how it affects the state.
- The **cost of actions**: If applicable, the agent assigns costs to actions, which helps in optimizing decision-making.

This model allows the agent to structure its problem in a way that it can systematically solve it.

### **4. Search for a Solution**
Before taking any real-world actions, the agent simulates potential solutions by searching through possible sequences of actions. The search involves exploring various paths from the initial state to the goal state and evaluating the outcomes of different action sequences. The agent may use different **search algorithms** to identify a valid sequence of actions that lead to the goal.

### **5. Action Selection**
Once the agent has found a solution (or part of a solution), it selects the next action in the sequence. The selection process is driven by the agent’s decision-making strategy, which can range from simple rules to complex evaluations based on costs, utilities, or other considerations.

### **6. Execution of Actions**
The agent now executes the chosen action, interacting with the environment in a way that brings it closer to the goal. The execution is often carried out in a step-by-step manner, where the agent follows the sequence of actions generated during the search phase.

### **7. Feedback and Iteration**
For each action taken, the agent assesses the result by perceiving the new state of the environment. If the goal has not yet been reached, the agent continues the loop, repeating the perception, goal assessment, and action selection phases. In some agents, this feedback loop also allows for learning, where the agent improves its problem-solving capabilities by refining its internal models or adjusting its behavior based on past actions.

### **Looping the Process**
Once the action is executed and the agent perceives the new state, it loops back to the perception and state update phase. This cycle repeats until the agent either reaches its goal or exhausts the possible actions it can take. The agent may also revise its goals or search for new solutions if the situation changes or if it encounters unexpected outcomes during execution.


## **Formulating Problems**

In problem-solving, **problem formulation** is the process of defining the problem in such a way that it can be solved systematically using search algorithms. To make the problem solvable, we typically need to **abstract** or simplify the problem, removing unnecessary details while preserving the essential aspects. 

### **Abstraction in Problem Formulation**
**Abstraction** refers to the process of creating a simplified version of the problem by removing irrelevant details and focusing on the key elements necessary for finding a solution. 

#### **Key Principles of Abstraction**:
1. **Validity**: The abstraction must be valid, meaning that any solution found using the abstract version of the problem should also be a solution in the more detailed, real-world problem.
   - **Example**: If you're planning a route for a robot in a building, you can abstract the problem by considering only room connections, not the exact distances between doors, as long as the chosen path works in the real-world setting.

2. **Usefulness**: The abstraction should simplify the problem so that it's easier to solve than the original, without introducing unnecessary complexity.
   - **Example**: A chess-playing AI can abstract the game by focusing on key moves and ignoring less important options (like rarely used openings), making it easier to compute the best strategy.

3. **Simplified Actions**: In a good abstraction, each action in the solution should be simpler to carry out than in the real-world problem.
   - **Example**: When simulating the movements of a robot vacuum cleaner, we can abstract its actions to "move left," "move right," and "clean," ignoring the physical details of the motor's operation.

### **Problem Representation as a Graph**
The state space of a problem can often be represented as a **graph**, where:
- **Vertices** (or nodes) represent the different possible **states** the environment can be in.
- **Edges** (or links) represent the **actions** that lead from one state to another.

In this representation:
- A **path** through the graph is a sequence of actions (edges) that lead from an **initial state** to a **goal state**.
- The **solution** to the problem is this path, which allows the agent to transition from the starting state to the goal state through valid actions.

### **State Space and Abstraction**
The **state space** is the set of all possible states the agent can be in, given the initial state and all the possible actions it can take. However, the real world is often too complex to represent fully, so we must abstract the state space to make it manageable.

- **Selecting a State Space**: The key is to balance between detail and simplicity. If the state space is too detailed, the problem will be too complex to solve. If it’s too simple, the solution may not be valid in the real world.

- **Abstraction in State Space**: The actions or states must be abstracted so that solving the problem in the abstract space is easier than in the original world.
   - **Example**: When planning a route for a robot in a house, we might ignore small obstacles like furniture and focus only on major room-to-room transitions.

### **Standardized Problems**
**Standardized problems** are simplified problems commonly used in research or teaching to demonstrate or test problem-solving methods. These problems help explore various search algorithms and strategies. Some standardized problems include:

1. **The 8-puzzle problem**: Rearranging tiles on a 3x3 grid to match a goal configuration.
2. **The traveling salesperson problem (TSP)**: Finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting point.

**Example: Vacuum World**
In the vacuum cleaner world, the goal is to clean a series of rooms. To simplify the problem:
- **States**: We abstract the state to represent whether a room is clean or dirty and where the vacuum cleaner is.
- **Actions**: We simplify the actions to "move left," "move right," and "clean."
- **Goal Test**: The goal is achieved when no rooms are dirty.
- **Path Cost**: Each action (moving or cleaning) costs 1 unit of time.

This abstraction allows the agent to focus on solving the problem of cleaning without worrying about small details like the vacuum's battery level or the exact mechanics of movement.

**Example: The 8-puzzle (Sokoban puzzle)**
- **States**: Represented by the positions of the tiles on a 3x3 grid.
- **Actions**: Moving the blank space up, down, left, or right to swap places with an adjacent tile.
- **Goal Test**: The tiles match the goal configuration.
- **Path Cost**: Each move costs 1 unit.

Note: Solving this problem optimally is **NP-hard**, meaning it requires significant computational resources as the problem size increases.

### **Real-World Problems**
In the real world, problem formulation and solving are more complex. The solutions must deal with various constraints, such as time, resources, and unpredictable changes in the environment. Here are a few real-world problem types:

1. **Air Travel Planning**:
   - **States**: Each state includes the current location (airport), time, and other information like flight status.
   - **Actions**: Take a flight, switch airports, or wait for a connecting flight.
   - **Goal Test**: Reach the destination within a certain time window.
   - **Path Cost**: Combination of time, money, comfort, and other factors.

2. **Robotic Assembly**:
   - **States**: Real-valued coordinates of robot joints and parts being assembled.
   - **Actions**: Continuous motions of robot joints to assemble parts.
   - **Goal Test**: The object is fully assembled without errors.
   - **Path Cost**: Time or energy required to complete the task.

### **Key Real-World Problem Types**:
1. **Touring Problems**: Problems where multiple locations must be visited, such as the **traveling salesperson problem (TSP)**. The goal is to find a route that visits every location while minimizing cost or time.
2. **Layout Problems**: These involve positioning components to maximize efficiency, such as in **VLSI chip layout**.
3. **Route-Finding Problems**: Common in navigation, where the agent must find the best path from one location to another, considering various constraints like time, distance, and cost.
*Note: Key Real-World Problem Types are not limited to the above three*

### **Components of a Search Problem:**

A **search problem** can be defined using the following elements:
- **State space**: The set of all possible states the environment can be in.
- **Initial state**: The state where the agent starts.
- **Goal state(s)**: The state(s) that the agent is trying to reach.
- **Actions**: The available actions the agent can take in any given state.
- **Transition model**: Defines how actions change the state of the environment.
- **Action costs**: The cost associated with taking a specific action.

### **Search Algorithms Used by Problem-Solving Agents**:

Problem-solving agents often use **search algorithms** to find a solution, such as:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all possible states at the current depth level before moving on to the next level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible in one direction before backtracking.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the least costly node first, making it optimal for problems where path cost matters.
- **A\***: Uses both the cost to reach the current state and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal, making it more efficient for complex problems.

## **Example Problem-Solving Process:**

Here are several examples of the **Problem-Solving Process** applied in different contexts:

---

### **1. Vacuum Cleaner World Example**

#### **Goal Formulation**:
The goal for the vacuum cleaner robot is to clean all rooms in the house.

#### **Problem Formulation**:
- **Initial State**: The robot starts in Room A, and Room A is dirty while Room B is clean.
- **Goal State**: Both Room A and Room B are clean.
- **Actions**: The robot can move left, move right, and clean the current room.
- **Transition Model**: Moving left or right changes the robot’s location, and cleaning removes dirt from the current room.
- **Action Cost**: Each move and cleaning action costs 1 unit of energy or time.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent simulates various sequences of actions such as:
1. Clean Room A.
2. Move to Room B.
3. Clean Room B.

It finds that the optimal solution is: **clean Room A → move right to Room B → clean Room B**.

#### **Execution**:
The robot executes the following sequence: 
1. Clean Room A.
2. Move to Room B.
3. Clean Room B.
Both rooms are now clean.

### **2. Maze Navigation Example**

#### **Goal Formulation**:
The goal is for a robot to navigate from the entrance to the exit of a maze.

#### **Problem Formulation**:
- **Initial State**: The robot starts at the maze entrance.
- **Goal State**: The robot reaches the maze exit.
- **Actions**: The robot can move up, down, left, or right in the maze.
- **Transition Model**: Moving in any direction takes the robot to a new position in the maze, unless blocked by a wall.
- **Action Cost**: Each move costs 1 step.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent searches through possible paths in the maze:
1. Start at the entrance.
2. Explore different directions (up, down, left, right).
3. Backtrack if the path is blocked or leads to a dead-end.
4. Continue exploring until a path to the exit is found.

Using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, the agent explores a valid path and identifies the shortest sequence of moves that lead to the exit.

#### **Execution**:
The robot follows the path identified during the search to successfully navigate from the entrance to the exit.

- **Goal State**: The car reaches Location B.
- **Actions**: The car can move forward, turn left, turn right, or stop at intersections.
- **Transition Model**: Each action moves the car to a new location along the road.
- **Action Cost**: Each action has a time cost based on road conditions and traffic.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent simulates different possible routes using a **Uniform Cost Search** or **A\*** algorithm:
1. Drive forward to the next intersection.
2. Turn left or right depending on the road layout and traffic conditions.
3. Continue until reaching Location B.

The agent evaluates traffic conditions and finds that the fastest route avoids heavy traffic by taking smaller side roads.

- **Goal State**: The tiles are arranged in numerical order from 1 to 8, with the empty space in the bottom right corner.
- **Actions**: Move the empty space left, right, up, or down to swap with an adjacent tile.
- **Transition Model**: Each move swaps the empty space with an adjacent tile, creating a new configuration.
- **Action Cost**: Each move costs 1 unit of effort or time.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent uses **A\*** search with the **Manhattan distance** heuristic to explore possible moves:
1. Swap tiles by moving the empty space.
2. Continue until the tile configuration matches the goal state.

The agent identifies the optimal sequence of moves to arrange the tiles in the correct order.

#### **Execution**:
The agent performs each move, swapping tiles until the puzzle is solved.

### **5. Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Example**

#### **Goal Formulation**:
The goal is to visit a set of cities and return to the starting city while minimizing the total distance traveled.

#### **Problem Formulation**:
- **Initial State**: The salesperson starts at a specific city.
- **Goal State**: The salesperson has visited all cities and returned to the starting point.
- **Actions**: The salesperson can travel between any pair of cities.
- **Transition Model**: Traveling from one city to another changes the current location of the salesperson.
- **Action Cost**: The cost is the distance between the cities.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent explores different sequences of cities using optimization algorithms like **Dynamic Programming** or **Genetic Algorithms**:
1. Visit the next closest city.
2. Repeat until all cities are visited.
3. Return to the starting city.

The agent finds the shortest possible route that visits all cities and returns to the starting point.

#### **Execution**:
The salesperson follows the optimized route to visit all cities with the least total distance.

### **6. Robot Pathfinding in a Warehouse Example**

#### **Goal Formulation**:
The goal is for a robot to collect items from different locations in a warehouse and deliver them to a designated area.

#### **Problem Formulation**:
- **Initial State**: The robot is at the starting point in the warehouse.
- **Goal State**: The robot has collected all items and delivered them to the delivery area.
- **Actions**: The robot can move in any direction, pick up items, or drop items.
- **Transition Model**: Moving in any direction updates the robot's location; picking up or dropping items changes the inventory state.
- **Action Cost**: Each movement and action has a time or energy cost.

#### **Search for a Solution**:
The agent uses **A\*** search to find the optimal route through the warehouse:
1. Move to the item’s location.
2. Pick up the item.
3. Move to the next item, repeating until all items are collected.
4. Deliver the items to the designated area.

The agent finds the most efficient sequence of movements to minimize the time spent collecting and delivering items.

#### **Execution**:
The robot follows the planned route, picking up and delivering items in the most efficient manner.

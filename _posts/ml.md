Supervise learning

In supervise learning, a machine or an agent learns from the input output provided.
 the agent or machine observes the input output
The agent of machine learns a function that maps from input to output

Unsupervised learning

The agent learns from input without any explicit feedback
Example clustering

reinforcement learning
The agent learns to reinforcement of feedback, which is either reward or punishment

Supervised learning

Regression
Hypothesis consistent hypothesis as H such that each XX in a training set has HX equals to Y
Look for a best fit for each HX is close to y

To two measure of hypothesis depends on how well it handles input it has not seen yet

At journalize as well, if it accurately predicts the output of the test set


The goal is to finding hypothesis to fit data

The tendency of a predicative hypothesis to derive from the expected value when average over different trainings

Under fitting happens when the hypothesis fails to find a pattern in the data
Variance is the amount of change in the hypothesis due to fluctuation in the training data
Over fitting is when it pays too much attention to the particular data set. It is training on causing it to perform poorly on unseen data.

Bias variance trade off
It is a choice between more complex, low bias hypothesis that fit the training data well and simpler lower variance hypothesis that may generalize better


Decision trees
Addition, three is a representation of a function that maps of vector of attribute values to a single output value
A decision three reaches its decision by performing a sequence of test starting at the root and following the appropriate branch until a leaf is reached
The initial note in the tree corresponds to a test of the value of one of the input attributes
The branch from the note are labeled when possible value of the attribute the leaf note specify what value is to be returned to by the function

A century is a representation of a function, that maps a factor of attribute values to a single output value, which is a decision
The tree reaches its decision by performing a sequence of test
It starts with the root and following the appropriate branches until a leaf note is reached
Each internal note in a tree corresponds to a test
The test checks, one of the input attributes, then decides on a branch note
The branch note from the note are labeled with positive values of the attribute
The branch leads to another note which performs another test until it reaches a leaf note
The leaf note specifies what value is to be returned by the function

Distant is equivalent to a logical statement of the form
Part one and part two and part three etc.

Entropy
Entropy is the measure of uncertainty of a random variable
The more information the less entropy
The fundamental quality in information theory

The information gained from the attribute test on a is expected reduction in entropy

Decent tree pruning helps combat over fitting
It eliminates notes that are not clearly relevant

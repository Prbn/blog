### How to Perform a Case Study for a Consulting Interview

Performing a case study effectively requires structured thinking, analytical skills, and practice. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of solving a consulting case study, using the five core types of cases outlined (Profitability, Market Entry, Market Sizing, Mergers & Acquisitions, and Other Cases). Whether you’re preparing for an upcoming interview or just starting out, this method will help you build confidence and competence.

#### Step 1: Understand the Case Prompt
1. **Listen Carefully (or Read the Prompt):**
   - When given a case (e.g., by an interviewer or in a practice scenario), listen actively to the problem statement. If practicing alone, read the case prompt thoroughly.
   - Example: “A bubble gum company has seen declining profitability over the past year. They want your help to figure out what’s going on.”

2. **Clarify the Objective:**
   - Identify what the client/company wants to achieve. Ask clarifying questions if needed (e.g., “Is the goal to restore profitability to previous levels, or just to diagnose the issue?”).
   - Write down the objective clearly: “Diagnose the cause of declining profitability and suggest solutions.”

3. **Take Notes:**
   - Jot down key details: company type, time frame (e.g., “past year”), and any initial data provided.

4. **Pause and Summarize:**
   - Briefly restate the problem to ensure understanding (e.g., “So, we’re helping a bubble gum company that was profitable but has seen a decline over the last year, and we need to figure out why.”). This shows you’re aligned with the problem.

#### Step 2: Choose and Announce Your Framework
1. **Identify the Case Type:**
   - Based on the prompt, classify the case into one of the five categories:
     - **Profitability:** Issues with revenue or costs (e.g., declining profits).
     - **Market Entry:** Expanding into a new market (e.g., PepsiCo entering Japan).
     - **Market Sizing:** Estimating a number (e.g., number of online students in the U.S.).
     - **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A):** Evaluating an acquisition (e.g., PepsiCo buying a water company).
     - **Other Cases:** Anything outside the above (e.g., a university’s brand issue).
   - If unsure, use the “Principal Component Analysis” approach (break the problem into 3-5 logical buckets).

2. **Select a Framework:**
   - Announce your framework aloud (or write it down if practicing solo) to structure your analysis. Here are the frameworks for each case type:
     - **Profitability:** Revenue (Price × Units Sold) - Costs (Fixed + Variable).
     - **Market Entry:** Market Size, Market Growth, Potential Share, Investment/Costs.
     - **Market Sizing:** Top-Down (start broad, narrow down) or Bottom-Up (start small, scale up).
     - **M&A:** Standalone Value, Synergies (Cost + Revenue), Quantitative/Qualitative Considerations.
     - **Other Cases:** Break into 3-5 principal components (e.g., for a university: Students, Faculty, Facilities, Curriculum, Programs).

3. **Explain Your Approach:**
   - Example: “For this profitability case, I’ll analyze it by breaking it into Revenue and Costs. Under Revenue, I’ll look at price per unit and units sold, and under Costs, I’ll examine fixed and variable costs. I’ll compare past and present data to pinpoint the issue.”

4. **Draw a Framework Tree:**
   - Sketch a simple diagram (on paper or mentally) to visualize your buckets. For profitability:
     ```
     Profit = Revenue - Costs
     ├── Revenue = Price × Units Sold
     └── Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs
     ```

#### Step 3: Gather Data and Ask Questions
1. **Request Information:**
   - Ask targeted questions to fill in your framework. Examples:
     - Profitability: “Can you provide last year’s revenue and cost data versus this year’s?”
     - Market Entry: “What’s the size of the beverage market in Japan, and how fast is it growing?”
     - Market Sizing: “What’s the U.S. population, and what percentage is college-aged?”
     - M&A: “What’s the bottled water company’s revenue, and what synergies might we expect?”
     - Other: “Are there any recent changes in the university’s faculty or student satisfaction?”

2. **Make Assumptions if Needed:**
   - If data isn’t provided (e.g., in solo practice), make reasonable assumptions and state them clearly. Example: “I’ll assume the U.S. population is 300 million, and 20% are aged 18-24.”

3. **Organize Data:**
   - Slot the data into your framework buckets as you receive it. For the bubble gum example:
     - Last Year: Revenue = $120M, Costs = $60M → Profit = $60M.
     - This Year: Revenue = $120M, Costs = $80M → Profit = $40M.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Problem
1. **Work Through the Framework Step-by-Step:**
   - Go bucket by bucket, analyzing the data or assumptions.
   - **Profitability Example:**
     - Revenue: Stable at $120M → “No change here.”
     - Costs: Increased from $60M to $80M → “This is the issue.”
     - Drill deeper into Costs:
       - Fixed Costs: Stable at $40M.
       - Variable Costs: Jumped from $20M to $40M → “This is the root cause.”
   - **Market Entry Example:**
     - Market Size: $30B → “Large market.”
     - Growth: 10% → “Growing market.”
     - Potential Share: 10% = $3B revenue → “Promising.”
     - Investment: $100B → “Too high to justify.”

2. **Do Quick Math:**
   - Perform calculations aloud (or write them down). Example:
     - Profitability: “Profit dropped from $60M to $40M, a $20M decline, all due to variable costs doubling.”
     - Market Sizing (Top-Down): “300M population × 20% college age = 60M; 50% in college = 30M; 50% online = 15M.”

3. **Identify the Problem:**
   - State the key insight clearly. Example: “The bubble gum company’s profitability issue stems from a $20M increase in variable costs, likely due to a more expensive supplier.”

#### Step 5: Propose Solutions or Conclusions
1. **Offer Actionable Recommendations:**
   - Based on your analysis, suggest solutions:
     - Profitability: “Switch to a cheaper supplier or renegotiate terms to reduce variable costs back to $20M.”
     - Market Entry: “If investment is $100B, it’s not worth entering Japan; if it’s $1B, proceed due to a 3-year breakeven.”
     - M&A: “Acquire the water company if synergies offset the acquisition cost within 5 years.”
   - Tie it to the objective: “This will restore profitability to $60M.”

2. **Consider Risks or Alternatives:**
   - Example: “Switching suppliers might risk quality, so we could also explore bulk discounts with the current supplier.”

3. **Summarize:**
   - Recap your findings and recommendation in 30 seconds: “The bubble gum company’s profits dropped due to variable costs rising from $20M to $40M because of a new supplier. I recommend renegotiating or switching suppliers to cut costs by $20M and restore profitability.”

#### Step 6: Practice and Refine
1. **Simulate Real Conditions:**
   - Practice with a partner who acts as the interviewer, providing data and asking follow-ups.
   - Time yourself (20-30 minutes per case).

2. **Handle Curveballs:**
   - If the interviewer throws a twist (e.g., “The supplier won’t negotiate”), adapt: “Then we could explore in-house production to control costs.”

3. **Reflect:**
   - After each case, review what went well (e.g., clear framework) and what didn’t (e.g., forgot to ask for cost breakdown). Adjust your approach.

4. **Build Intuition:**
   - Practice 10-20 cases per type to internalize frameworks and improve speed. Use resources like case books (e.g., Case in Point) or online platforms (e.g., PrepLounge).

---

#### Tips for Success
- **Be Structured:** Always announce your framework upfront and stick to it.
- **Communicate Clearly:** Talk through your thought process aloud, even when calculating.
- **Stay Calm:** If stuck, take a 10-second pause to regroup and proceed logically.
- **Practice Numbers:** Get comfortable with mental math (e.g., percentages, multiplication).
- **Adapt:** If the case doesn’t fit a standard type, break it into 3-5 logical buckets and proceed.

### Example Walkthrough: Profitability Case
**Prompt:** “A bubble gum company’s profits have declined over the past year. Diagnose the issue.”
1. **Clarify:** “I’ll assume the goal is to identify the cause and suggest fixes.”
2. **Framework:** “I’ll break it into Revenue (Price × Units) and Costs (Fixed + Variable).”
3. **Questions:** “What were last year’s revenue and costs versus this year’s?”
   - Data: Last year: $120M revenue, $60M costs. This year: $120M revenue, $80M costs.
4. **Analysis:**
   - Revenue: Stable at $120M.
   - Costs: Up $20M (Fixed: $40M both years; Variable: $20M to $40M).
   - Insight: “Variable costs doubled, likely due to a supplier change.”
5. **Solution:** “Renegotiate with the supplier or find a cheaper one to cut $20M in costs.”
6. **Summary:** “Profits fell $20M due to variable costs rising from $20M to $40M. Switching suppliers can restore profitability.”
